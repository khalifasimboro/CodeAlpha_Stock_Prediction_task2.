STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING LSTM

This project aims to predict the stock price of any company using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The example provided in this repository uses the Tesla stock price dataset.

INTRODUCTION

Accurate stock price prediction is crucial for investors and financial analysts. This project leverages LSTM neural networks to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The implementation is done entirely in Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow and modify.

FEATURES

Data Source: Tesla stock price data with the following columns:
 
  - Date: Date
  - High: Highest price
  - Low: Lowest price
  - Open: Opening price
  - Close: Closing price adjusted for splits and dividends
  - Volume: Stock volume
  - Adj Close: Closing price adjusted for splits
  - Model: LSTM neural network for time series prediction.
  - Implementation: Fully implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
  - Visualization: Visualize predicted stock prices against actual prices.

REQUIEREMENTS

1. Tools:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load your own stock price data.
   - Preprocess the data for the LSTM model.
   - Build, compile, and train the LSTM model.
   - Predict future stock prices.
   - Visualize the predictions.
   
RESULTS

The notebook includes visualizations of the predicted stock prices compared to the actual prices. These visualizations help to understand the model's performance and accuracy.
